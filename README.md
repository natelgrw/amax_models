# AMAX-1: UV-Vis λ<sub>max</sub> Prediction for LC-MS Applications

**AMAX-1** is an open source dataset designed to assist machine learning models in small molecule **UV-Vis absorption maxima (λ<sub>max</sub>)** prediction and LC-MS **compound characterization workflows**.

## 📊 The AMAX-1 Dataset

The **AMAX-1 dataset** contains:

- **40,026 molecule–solvent combinations**, the largest λ<sub>max</sub> dataset of its kind to date
- Experimentally measured **λ<sub>max</sub> values** curated from public datasets, benchmark papers, and literature

The dataset is actively expanding with new experimental λ<sub>max</sub> values from the **Coley Research Group at MIT**, ensuring AMAX-1 remains a growing resource for optical property prediction.

The dataset is designed for use in:

- Estimating λ<sub>max</sub> for new compound–solvent pairs
- Aiding in peak assignment during LC-MS method development
- Supporting generalized chromophore engineering and spectral ML workflows
