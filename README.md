# AMAX-1: A Benchmark Dataset and Machine Learning Model for UV-Vis λmax Prediction

**AMAX-1** is an extensive dataset containing over **30,000 molecule – solvent combinations** along with their corresponding **UV-Vis absorbance maxima (λmax) values**. The dataset also includes a wide range of **chemical descriptors** and **molecular fingerprints** calculated using **PaDEL-Descriptor** and **RDKit**.

In addition to the dataset, **AMAX-1** will include a fully trained, optimized machine learning model for λmax prediction, selected from a benchmark of over **numerous algorithms**.

Designed to accelerate research in spectral property prediction, virtual screening, and chromophore design, **AMAX-1** serves as both a benchmark dataset and a pretrained model for λmax estimation, laying the groundwork for future foundation models in spectral learning tasks.

## The AMAX-1 Dataset

**AMAX-1** compiles λmax values from three previously established datasets: **SMFluo1**, **UVVsiML**, and **ChemDataExtractor**, bringing the total amount of molecule - solvent combinations covered to **31,516**. Additionally, the dataset is actively expanding through the continuous addition of new experimental λmax data from the **Coley Research Group** at **MIT**.

Each molecule and solvent is supported by a comprehensive set of over 300 molecular descriptors calculated through **PaDEL** and **RDKit**.
